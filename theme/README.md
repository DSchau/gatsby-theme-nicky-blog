#### `pagination` options

| `prefixPath`   | `""`          | Optional string. Path for paginated pages: eg: `/prefixPath/2` |

#### Example usage

```js
// gatsby-config.js
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    {
      resolve: "@nickymeuleman/gatsby-theme-blog",
      options: {
        contentPath: "posts",
        basePath: "blog",
        pagination: {
          postsPerPage: 10,
          prefixPath: "page",
        },
      },
    },
  ],
}
```

#### Additional configuration

In addition to the theme options, there are a handful of items you can customize via the `siteMetadata` object in your site's `gatsby-config.js`

```js
// gatsby-config.js
module.exports = {
  siteMetadata: {
    // Used for the site title, SEO, and header component title.
    title: `My Blog Title`,
    // Used for SEO
    description: `My site description...`,
    // Used for SEO and as default if an author has no twitter defined
    social: {
      twitter: `@NMeuleman`,
    },
  },
}
```

### Adding blog posts

Inside that folder, an `index.mdx` or `index.md` file will be the blog post itself. Along this file can be several different files that can then be referenced easily inside that `.md(x)` file.
In the folder that was created for the `contentPath` (`content` by default). Create a folder to hold a blog post. By default, the title of this folder will serve as the slug for the blogpost.
By default, the date the `.mdx` file was created will serve as the date for the blogpost.
(see [Anatomy of a blogpost](#anatomy-of-a-blogpost) for the ability to override these defaults).

### Adding authors

In the folder that was created for the `contentPath` (`content` by default). Create a file called `authors.json` or `authors.yaml`. This file (or files, both formats can work together) holds an array of author objects.

#### Example folder tree

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ content
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ my-first-post
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index.mdx
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ coverPhoto.jpg
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ boop.png
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ infinite-boop.gif
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ my-second-post
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ index.md
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ f1-car.jpg
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ speed-data.svg
â””â”€â”€ assets
    â”œâ”€â”€ authors.yaml
    â””â”€â”€ image-used-often.jpg
```
<!-- 
# content
## my-first-post
### index.mdx
### coverPhoto.jpg
### boop.png
### infinite-boop.gif
## my-second-post
### index.md
### f1-car.jpg
### speed-data.svg
# assets
## authors.yaml 
## image-used-often.jpg
-->
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

#### Anatomy of an authors file

An authors file contains a top level array filled with object describing individual authors.
An author can have several different field with information specific to them.

| Key         | Value  | Required | Description                                                                 |
| ----------- | ------ | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `shortName` | string | yes      | **unique** identifier for the author, used in `author` field for blog posts |
| `name`      | string | yes      | full name eg. "Nicky Meuleman"                                              |
| `twitter`   | string | no       | twitter handle without @                                                    |

#### Anatomy of a blogpost

The blogpost itself (`.md` or `.mdx` file for now, others coming soon) can have several different fields with extra information. Some of these are required.
In `.md` or `.mdx` files those are set via the frontmatter.

| Key            | Value                                       | Required | Description                               |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `title`        | string                                      | no       | title of your blogpost                    |
| `date`         | date string                                 | no       | the date tied to the post                 |
| `canonicalUrl` | full url string                             | no       | Canonical url                             |
| `author`       | author `shortName` or array of `shortName`s | no       | Author of the post                        |
| `tags`         | array of tag strings                        | no       | tags for this post                        |
| `keywords`     | array of keyword strings                    | no       | keywords for SEO                          |
| `cover`        | relative path to cover image                | no       | displayed as cover image, in social cards |
| `published`    | boolean, defaults to `true`                 | no       | include post in production                |
| `slug`         | string                                      | no       | the last part of the URL for this post    |

notes:
The `authors` key also works, because defining multiple author**s** under a singular author key feels weird.

### Exported components

The included components are larely unstyled implementations to show an example of what is possible.
Overwriting these with you own is highly encouraged. This can be done via [component shadowing](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2019-04-29-component-shadowing/).

#### List of components:

- BlogList
- BlogPost
- Pagination
- PostCard
- TagList
- TagPage
- UnderPost

#### List of layout/global style related components

- GlobalStyles
- Header
- layout
- Main

#### How to shadow components

If you want to use [component shadowing](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2019-04-29-component-shadowing/), create a file at the following path in your site:

```
src/@nickymeuleman/gatsby-theme-blog/components/<component-name>.js
```

#### Example usage in MDX

In any MDX blogpost:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
```mdx
import { <component-name> } from "@nickymeuleman/gatsby-theme-blog"
---
<frontmatter-fields>
---

# Lorem Ipsum
<component-name />
```
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

#### Example usage in React components

In any React component:

```jsx
import React from "react"
import { <component-name> } from "@nickymeuleman/gatsby-theme-blog"

export default () => (
  <div>
    <component-name />
  </div>
)
```
